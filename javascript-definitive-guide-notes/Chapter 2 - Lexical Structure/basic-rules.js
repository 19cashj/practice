// Javascript is case-sensitive. Capitalization matters for everything.

// It ignores spaces that appear between tokens in programs.

// It ignores line breaks (for the most part, there is an exception)

// Literals below:

12 // the number twelve
1.2 // The number one point two
"hello word" // a string
'Hi' // another string
`Sup` // another another string (but you can use template literals `${}`)
true // a boolean
false // the other boolean
null // Absence of an object

// You can identify constants, variables, properties, functions, and classes with few limits
// They must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign. Numbers are not allowed as the first character
// You also cannot use reserved words
// They are:  as const export get null target void async continue extends if of this while await debugger false import return throw with break default finally
// in set true yield case delete for instanceof static try catch do from let super typeof class else function new switch var
// Also restricted words: enum implements interface package private protected public arguments eval

// Javascript uses semicolons as seperators like other languages, but in some cases they are completely optional.

a = 3
b = 4
// no semis needed

a = 3; b = 4
// semis needed

// Do not insert line breaks between return, break, or continue
