# practice
There will be nothing truly "of value" in here. Only uploading practice projects that are so small they don't deserve their own repo. However this helps me track what I am learning no matter how small.

I was inspired to do this because I realized I was practicing programming pretty much every single day but this wasn't shown on my github. Now it is! No more excuses...
