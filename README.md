# practice
There will be nothing truly "of value" in here. Only uploading practice projects that are so small they don't deserve their own repo (some even so small you could call them "exercises"). However this helps me track what I am learning no matter how small.

I was inspired to do this because I realized I was practicing programming pretty much every single day but this wasn't shown on my github. Now it is! No more excuses...
